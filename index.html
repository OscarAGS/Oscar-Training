    <h3>Subjects Studied</h3>
    <ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
        <li>Robotic and Automation
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                <li>
                    This subject consists in do a simulated plant that one robot pick up a piece
                    from machine one or machine two and put the piece in a transfer. Every one
                    hundred and eighty seconds the robot need to put one piece from machine one to
                    the point of test, ten seconds later need to take the piece and put this on the
                    transfer. When the piece arrive to the PLC this will know if is from the machine
                    one or two because if it is from the machine two it will be discarded and if it
                    is from machine one will start all the process from the PLC.
                </li>

        <li>Electronic Instrumentation
            <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                This subject consists in studi diferents sensors and how it works with diferents
                methods and envirotments. Also explain us how to solve diferents problems about
                sensors and what this can influence with the machines and the scale that we
                work.
